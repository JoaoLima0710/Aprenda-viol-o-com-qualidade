# Synchronization Walkthrough

I have synchronized the project files and the brain context with your Windows environment.

## Changes Made

### Project Context (Brain)
- Created a `.brain/` directory in the repository root.
- Copied artifacts from the local Mac brain folders:
    - `768b7ca2-7cab-48ce-a589-24d01b7b2843`
    - `f64f7c92-4591-4f8a-9880-b2f47a912b56`
- Committed and pushed these changes to [JoaoLima0710/tutor-music](https://github.com/JoaoLima0710/tutor-music.git).

## How to Synchronize on Windows

1. Open your terminal or git client on Windows.
2. Navigate to your local `tutor-music` repository.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. All synchronization artifacts will be available in the `.brain/` folder.

## Verification Results

- `git push` completed successfully:
    ```
    To https://github.com/JoaoLima0710/tutor-music.git
       9515105..432461b  main -> main
    ```
- All `.md` artifacts from the current and previous sessions are included in the repository.
